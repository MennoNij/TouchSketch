# TouchSketch
A sketching environment optimized for touch-based interaction.

TouchSketch was created as part of my masters' project for Computer Science, as is provided as-is. For more information regarding the techniques I applied, check out [my thesis](http://scripties.fwn.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/scripties/Informatica/Master/2009/Nijboer.M./)

Compiling TouchSketch requires:
- FreeType 2
- Large Display Framework
- QT 4.0
